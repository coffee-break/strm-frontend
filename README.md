## Findings

### 02/12/2015 

* Intellij is not refactoring typescript class names together with file names
* Intellij is braking imports  ```from 'angular2/angular2'``` when file is moved
* material design seams to be not supported, 
there may be issues with angular2 lifecycle and angular material ligth js dependency
